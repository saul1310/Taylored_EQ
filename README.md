# Taylored_EQ
A simple 3 band equalizer plugin for logic pro written in c++ with JUCE.

JUCE will be used for its built in Audio Engine and real time audio processing capabilities.
It also has a powerful UI toolkit for designing custom interfaces for audio plugins.
If i finish this project im gonna buy myself a full size keyboard mine is small and sounds terrible.
